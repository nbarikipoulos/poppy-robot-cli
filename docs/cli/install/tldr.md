Intall Poppy CLI as:
  - A npm package:
  ```shell
  npm install poppy-robot-cli -g
  ```
  - Or a standalone executable:
    - Available on this [page](https://github.com/nbarikipoulos/poppy-robot-cli/releases/latest) for Windows,
    - Or, in the end, read [here](#linuxmacosothers) for MacOS/Linux/Others.

Once installed, just type:
